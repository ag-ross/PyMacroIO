# Dynamic Disequilibrium Model with Input-Output Structure

A Python implementation of a Dynamic Disequilibrium [^d] Model with Input-Output Structure. It features multiple production rules, inventory dynamics, labour adjustment, multi-region support, endogenous macro closure rules, and two exemplary shock types.

[^d]: Disequilibrium: persistent possibility of excess demand or supply, with quantity adjustment and rationing rather than instantaneous price-mediated market clearing.

## Overview

The model uses an input-output table as its structural backbone but is best understood as a dynamic disequilibrium macroeconomic model: production is supply- and capacity-constrained, labour and inventories adjust with friction, and quantity rationing takes the place of price-mediated market clearing. It is discrete-time and sector-level. A multi-region structure with R ≥ 1 regions is supported. Production can be Leontief, adapted Leontief, linear, or CES. Household demand follows a Muellbauer or LES rule, whilst government spending and investment can follow endogenous macro closure rules or remain fixed at base-year levels. Full model equations and implementation details are in `docs/Mathematical_summary.pdf`.

## Modelling approach

Standard input-output analysis rests on the Leontief condition **x** = **Ax** + **f**, which requires markets to clear simultaneously through price adjustment. pyMacroIO does not impose this. Production at each period is the minimum of labour capacity, available inventories, and demand. Any shortfall is allocated by proportional rationing, whilst any surplus remains as idle capacity. Persistent gaps between supply and demand are the normal state, not a transient condition to be resolved.

The period-*t* solution follows a fixed recursive sequence: given the state at the end of period *t* − 1, the model computes labour, household demand, intermediate orders, aggregate demand, production, deliveries, inventory update, and profits in that order, with no step within a period feeding back into an earlier one. The outcome is therefore determined by direct evaluation rather than by solving a simultaneous equation system. The Leontief inverse enters only at the calibration stage, where the column viability condition (all column sums of **A** strictly below one) ensures it exists, and this condition is verified at model initialisation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

No installation is required. Clone or copy the repository and run from the project root so that the default data file (`data/example_data.pkl`) is found, or set `ModelConfig.data_path` explicitly. Example data are derived from a subset of EXIOBASE (see References, item 4).

## Quick Start

### Baseline run

```python
from pyMacroIO import ModelConfig, ScenarioManager, MonteCarloUncertaintyAnalysis

config = ModelConfig(
    n_periods=60,
    time_frequency="daily",
    prod_function="leontief.adapted",   # default; also "leontief", "linear", "ces"
)
manager = ScenarioManager(config)
baseline_run = manager.run_baseline(force=True)
```

### Consumption-shock scenario

```python
from pyMacroIO import run_consumption_shock_scenario, ScenarioManager

scenario_run, baseline_run = run_consumption_shock_scenario(
    intensity=0.2, duration=3, start=2,
)
comparison = ScenarioManager.compare_to_baseline(scenario_run, baseline_run)
# comparison["gdp_pct"], comparison["consumption_pct"]
```

### Input-availability shock

```python
from pyMacroIO import run_input_availability_shock_scenario

scenario_run, baseline_run = run_input_availability_shock_scenario(
    input_sector_label=None,   # uses key supplier (largest forward supply)
    reduction_pct=0.3,
    duration=3,
    start=2,
    inventory_days=5.0,
)
```

### Endogenous macro closures

```python
from pyMacroIO import ModelConfig, ScenarioManager

config = ModelConfig(
    n_periods=60,
    gov_income_elasticity=-0.3,        # counter-cyclical government spending
    investment_closure="keynesian",     # scales investment with lagged savings
)
manager = ScenarioManager(config)
baseline_run = manager.run_baseline(force=True)
```

## Key Features

**Core model**

- `InputOutputModel`: R ≥ 1 regions, production functions `leontief`, `leontief.adapted`, `linear`, `ces`
- `ModelConfig`: all scenario-overridable parameters with validation
- Inventories: beginning-of-period stocks constrain production; end-of-period stocks rebuild from realised deliveries with a damped positive restocking rule
- Labour: sector-specific hiring and firing speeds, disruption, and capacity bounds
- Household demand: Muellbauer rule or LES (`subsistence_shares`); closure modes `return_to_base`, `scarred`, `frozen`; LES calibration via `build_subsistence_shares_vector`
- Government spending: income-indexed with elasticity `gov_income_elasticity` (default 0.0 holds spending at the base-year level)
- Investment closure: `investment_closure="keynesian"` scales investment demand with lagged aggregate savings; default `"fixed"` holds it at base year
- Technical change: piecewise-constant productivity events

**Trade closures**

- Import flexibility (`import_flexibility`): per-sector fraction of an inventory shortfall coverable by external imports
- Sourced supplement (`row_supply_cap`): caps the share of RoW output diverted to source the import supplement
- Export pull (`export_pull`): absorbs capacity slack as additional external demand

**Scenarios and uncertainty**

- `ScenarioManager`: cached baseline, scenario runs with shock callables, comparison to baseline
- Shock helpers: `run_consumption_shock_scenario`, `run_input_availability_shock_scenario`, `run_consumption_shock_all_prod_functions`, `run_input_availability_shock_all_prod_functions`, household-closure sensitivity variants, and `run_input_availability_sensitivity_panel`
- `MonteCarloUncertaintyAnalysis`: parameter sampling, ensemble runs, mean and quantile metrics for GDP, consumption, and gross output

## Example data

The default data file is `data/example_data.pkl` (single region) or `data/example_data_2region.pkl` (two-region example). Required entries: `sector_labels`, `Z0` (N×N intermediate flows), `cons_vec`, `gov_vec`, `inv_vec`, `invnt_vec`, `exp_vec` (final-demand vectors), `l0`, `cap0`, `tax0`, `imp0` (value-added components), `consumer_taxes_total`, `fd_imports_totals`. Multi-region datasets additionally include `region_map` and `region_labels`. Row and value-added identities are checked at load. Full definitions are in `docs/Mathematical_summary.pdf`. Example data are derived from EXIOBASE (see References, item 4).
